##  Good Research uncovers Clear Problems making Great Products.

When a team deeply understands the problem they’re solving, there’s confidence, alignment and prioritisation are smooth, and defining solution-experiments is easy and can be done methodically. This results in great products that delight customers.

And yet, in many startups…

Research is skipped, products are built on assumptions, and countless hours of dev time are lost.
Poorly conducted research gives false confirmations and unreliable conclusions.
And even when there is good research, there’s a gap between insights and strategy.
